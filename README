%% Drawing Basic phasor diagram 
% This code shows how to draw a basic phasor and use plot window 
% simultaneously. 
% Here, in this code I have used annotation for drawing arrow. 
% Also, to change its X and Y dimension of header, sliders have been 
% provided. 
% Further you can use this code to do calculate resultant phasor of more than 
% two phasors. 
% x_cord and y_cord can be made global and used for calculating resultant 
% vector.
